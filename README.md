# Galactic-Structure
Software and data for research into galactic structure.

This repository is intended for public use in the study of galaxy structure, particularly the relationship between morphology, mass, angular momentum, and distance indicators.

It contains both software and observational data for analyzing spiral galaxy properties, including a large set of rotation curve profiles useful for kinematic and structural studies. The data and tools may be of particular interest to those working on empirical scaling laws or seeking alternatives to conventional distance measures.

## Data Description
The dataset includes over 874 rotation profiles of southern hemisphere galaxies, originally collected by Mathewson at the Silver Springs Observatory, Australia. Tragically, the original archive was destroyed in a bushfire that consumed the observatoryâ€™s library.

Fortunately, a magnetic tape copy had been ordered and preserved by Paolo Salucci, who later organized and distributed the data for scientific use. This repository would not exist without his foresight and efforts.

Additional Notes
Several files in this repository reflect prior and ongoing exploratory work, including attempts to relate morphological features to galactic dynamics. This README will be expanded as the research develops.
